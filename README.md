## PSYCH 1140 Portfolio Project - Color Awareness with Webcam Eyetracking

### Summary

This site uses webcam eyetracking to saturate only the area of the image being focused on. I wanted to see if a general lack of color awareness observed in Cohen's 2020 study with VR headsets could also be translated to webcam eyetracking.
